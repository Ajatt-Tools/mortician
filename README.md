Do you hate failing the same card over and over?
Well, now you can bury it after a certain number of failed attempts.
By default any card that has been answered 'again' at least 5 times for the past 24 hours
get buried automatically. You can tweak these values in the config.

This addon is inspired by [DA KILL Z0NE](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1565222544),
but differs from it a little:
- DA KILL Z0NE doesn't work, but this addon works.
